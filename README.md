#JQuery animation practice lab

In this lab, you will be challenged to animate a box in many different ways to get accustomed to the JQuery animation library. In the index.html page, there are a set of buttons. Each one is labeled with a different action that should be performed when they are clicked.

###Fade In
When this button is clicked, the box should fade in from being invisible to completely visible.

###Fade out
The exact opposite of fade in. The box should fade out from being visible to invisible.

###Change color to blue/green
The box's color should change from whatever its current color is to blue or green respectively.


###Slide up and slide down
When these buttons are clicked, the box should animate from being very short to its normal size and vice versa. An example of this behavior is [here](http://www.webdesignerwall.com/demo/jquery/simple-slide-panel.html).
